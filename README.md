WordLexa - Word Game Helper App

A practical and powerful word finder assistant designed for players who enjoy word games such as Scrabble®, Words With Friends (WWF), and similar letter-based puzzles.
The app supports both Turkish and English dictionaries, each working independently with a local offline structure.

## Turkish Dictionary
The Turkish word database contains over 46,000 words based on Turkish Language Association (TDK) sources. For Turkish words, users can also view word meanings by tapping on search results.

## English Dictionary
The English dictionary works fully offline using a local word database. Word definitions are not displayed yet for English words.

Users can easily: define which letter a word should start with, which letter it should end with or which letters it must contain.

The “?” wildcard character can be used to represent missing letters and discover additional word combinations.
